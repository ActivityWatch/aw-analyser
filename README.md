===========

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ActivityWatch/aw-research.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ActivityWatch/aw-research)

Tools to analyse and experiment with ActivityWatch data.

Some of the things developed here might become ActivityWatch features, and others are starting points for research as talked about in [this issue](https://github.com/ActivityWatch/activitywatch/issues/236).


## Usage

```
pipenv install
pipenv run python3 -m aw_research --help
```

To use some of the analysis methods you need to create some configuration files manually, examples of these will be added later.
